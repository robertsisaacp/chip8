recreating and emulating Chip-8 architecture

Using Laurence Muller's excellent guide (http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/)
I'm attempting to recreate and emulate the chip-8 architecture in c++. Whereas Laurence's guide makes heavy use of C-style
primitives; and logic (switch cases), my own goal is to modernize the code trading some C-level speed for the conveniences and
flexibility of c++11's features.
