recreating and emulating Chip-8 architecture

Using Laurence Muller's excellent guide (http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-chip-8-interpreter/)
I'm attempting to recreate and emulate the Chip-8 architecture in C++. Whereas Laurence's guide makes heavy use of C-style
primitives; and logic (switch cases.. switch cases everywhere), my own goal is to modernize the code trading some C-level speed for the conveniences and flexibility of C++11's (and 14) features.

There will be lambdas.
